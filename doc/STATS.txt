Hi :-)

We're building a simple stats' table on the wiki, at this address: http://laltromondo.dynalias.net/~iki//informatica/soft/birbabot/
It would be kind if you let us know the following details about your birbabot's usage so that we can keep an up-to-date sheet about the currently running bots.

"Owner - Bot-Nick - Network - Channel - SSl (Y/N) - Operating System"

Thanks and happy meeeowing.
