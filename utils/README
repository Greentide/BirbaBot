## dpkg/#debian Bot database Import Utility

This Utility can be used to import the factoids table from the mysql database of "dpkg",
an IRC bot which runs in freenode/oftc #debian channels, to the sqlite database of BirbaBot.

## How it works

First you need to setup a mysql database and import dpkg's data.

A nightly exported dump of dpkg's db can be found at: http://crito.ucr.edu/~dpkg/
Save it to disk and gunzip it.
Import apt_dump in your mysql databse like:

$ mysql -u user -p dbname < apt_dump

Then you need to stop BirbaBot, copy its sqlite db (birba.db) into this same dir where
this README is located.

Finally edit "dpkg_facts-import.pl" and set the custom variables for the sql connection handles.
Make the script executable if it's not and run it:

$ ./dpkg_facts-import.pl

Copy the updated birba.db back to the root of BirbaBot, start the bot.
