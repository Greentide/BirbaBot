SQL DATABASE

rss.sql is the file where we keep the main SCHEMA for the sqlite database
So, first of all we import that on a new rss.db:

sqlite3 rss.db < sql/rss.sql

And, since we don't already have a function to add new rss feeds, we use another .sql file to add them manually
A valid example is the sql/myfeeds.sql file, which we can modify and import after the main SCHEMA:

sqlite3 rss.db < sql/myfeeds.sql

Now we can start birbabot
