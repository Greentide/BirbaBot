## How to use special keywords

Each factoid in BirbaBot can have at maximum 3 different definitions, like bar1, bar2 and bar3.
Special keywords just works for the first key definition "bar1".

The keywords are:

1) <reply> $who  (addressing)
2) <reply> see   (recursion)
3) <action>      (ctcp action)

What do they do?

1)

"$who" gets evaluated and substituted with the nickname of the person who asked the factoid.
The factoid's value must always begin with the keyword "<reply>" and the factoid must have ONLY
 one definition (bar1) for it to work.

EXAMPLE:

@kw new hello is <reply> hello $who!

asking: hello?
outputs: hello roughneks!

2)

The word "see" operates like a recursion and it is transparent to the user.
The factoid's value must always begin with the keyword "<reply> see" and the factoid must have ONLY
 one definition (bar1) for it to work.

EXAMPLE:

@kw new hi is <reply> see hello
@kw new hello is Hello, how are you today?

asking: hi?
does a query against "hi" -> finds a "<reply> see" tag followed by "hello" -> does a new query against "hello" 
outputs: Hello, how are you today?

3)

The keyword <action> triggers the bot to spit a factoid while doing a "ctcp action".
The factoid's value must always begin with the keyword "<action>" and the factoid must have ONLY
 one definition (bar1) for it to work.

EXAMPLE

@kw new smile is <action> lols :)
asking: smile?
the bot performs a ctcp action
outputs: * Birba lols :)
